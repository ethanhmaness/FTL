<![CDATA[
Adds 3 weapons and 1 combat drone based around super-hot plasma weaponry which excel at keeping vital systems down and killing enemy crew. All plasma weapons start fires and deal double crew damage. These should appear in any store or random event, with medium to high rarity.

Scorch Shot Laser - 1 power, 1 shot, 9 second charge
Scorch Flak Mark I - 2 power, 2 shots, 10 second charge, tight spread
Scorch Flak Mark II - 3 power, 5 shots, 18 second charge, wide spread
Anti-Ship Scorch Drone - Combat 1, but takes 3 power and shoots plasma.

		Suggestions for the description...

		Write a short paragraph about the mod's effect first (what style ship, how
		does it affect gameplay). No need to introduce yourself.

		Optionally add a paragraph of background flavor.

		Optionally list important features.

		List any concerns about mod compatibility, preferred order, or requirements.

		Mention "Replaces the XYZ ship." if relevant.
			Kestrel-A, Engi-A,    Fed-A,     Zoltan-A,
			Stealth-A, Rock-A,    Slug-A,    Mantis-A,
			Lanius-A,  Crystal-A

		Above all, keep the description general, so you won't have to edit
		that again for each new version.
